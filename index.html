  <h1>Interactive Font Styling</h1>
  <p>This project leverages Teachable Machine to classify fonts as Serif or Sans Serif through real-time camera input. By integrating a pre-trained model with p5.js, users can dynamically adjust on-screen text according to detected font styles. Future enhancements will allow users to control additional typography elements—such as character spacing, bold, and italic—using intuitive hand gestures. This innovative approach brings a hands-free, interactive design experience, blending AI with creative typography manipulation.</p>
